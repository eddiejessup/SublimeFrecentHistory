# Acknowledgements

- This is a more-or-less from-scratch re-implementation of [FileHistory](https://github.com/FichteFoll/FileHistory) by [Josh Bjornson](https://github.com/FichteFoll). The structure is inspired by theirs, so thanks.
- I've vendored the minimal requirements of [natural](https://natural.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and in turn [six](https://github.com/benjaminp/six)  since natural uses it. So thanks to those people.
- I ripped off the frecency metric from `fasd` by [Wei Dai](https://github.com/clvv), so thanks to them.
